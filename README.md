Miles - BITCOIN SV HACKATHON May 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------
This application is intended as an entry for the BSV Hackathon May 2019. The intention of this entry is to compete as a "concept" rather than competing in the field of innovative code or as an innovative technical solution. Since I was not trained as a developer, I certainly do not have the illusion that I can compete with my fellow candidates in this area. This concept is intended to demonstrate a commercially viable use case that has clear added value and benefits over comparable solutions that are currently available because it utilizes BitCoin SV.

WHAT IS MILES?
--------------
Miles is an simple mileage log application that leverages the unique properties of Bitcoin SV.



VISION ON ONBOARDING
-------------

Onboarding to BitCoin SV is a two-fold problem.
  - Distribution of BSV, and
  - Familiarize people with the technology and generate awareness about the benefits of BitCoin SV


DISTRIBUTION OF BSV

A much-discussed issue is how to enable people to obtain BitCoin SV. This is in my opinion a problem that can easily be solved and will resolve itself if there is sufficient demand for applications that utilize the unique characteristics that only Bitcoin SV can offer. In addition, this problem can also be easily solved by application suppliers if they work with a subscription fee where they accept Fiat money and implement a BitPipe (https://github.com/unwriter/bitpipe) solution to facilitate BitCoin transactions for end-users. This way the end-user does not even have to be aware that BitCoin SV is being used.

FAMILIARIZE PEOPLE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND BENIFITS OF BITCOIN SV

The real problem with onboarding as I view it is to get enough people familiar with the technology and to make them aware of the added value that BitCoin SV has to offer. If you succeed in this, demand will naturally arise. You can achieve this by offering applications that demonstrate the different facets of BitCoin SV.



THE ADDED VALUE OF ADMINISTRATION ON BITCOIN 
--------------------------------------------
BitCoin has a number of special qualities that are of particular interest for business administration and provides added value for many business administrative operations. In particular if the administration is intended as evidence for internal or external control. In evidence, important elements to record are: Who, What, Where, Why, When.

BitCoin has clear added value in particular in regard to Who and When:

  - Who is provable thanks to the use of a public and private key
  
  - When is provable thanks to a generated timestamp

The aspects What, Where and Why must be recorded by the user. BitCoin cannot prevent human errors in administrative actions, but it does make fraud considerably more difficult and much easier to trace.

The Write Once, Read Many (WORM) quality of BitCoin and the decentralized data storage ensure that once data has been recorded it cannot be changed by anyone afterwards or that all mutations are transparent.
