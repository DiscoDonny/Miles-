BITCOIN SV HACKATHON May 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------

This project is made as entry for the BSV Hackathon May 2019. The purpose of this entry is to participate in the competition with an "onboarding scheme" in combination with an application concept. The application concept mainly serves as an example of an app business or the general public would find useful today and that could implement the proposed onboarding scheme. The objective of this entry is to stand out in the competition not in the field of innovative coding or to create an high tech technical solution (this is not my skillset, I am not software developer) but by proposing an actual solution that could be out there and viable in a matter of a couple of weeks. The application concept demonstrates an commercially viable product that utilizes BitCoin SV. Also because it is build on BitCoin SV it has advantages over comparable solutions currently available. The entry concludes with a wishlist of features I would have like to include if I had the team and budget to make this into a real application available for the general public in mobile app stores.

A. The Onboarding scheme 

   The proposed onboarding scheme is a “freemium” model but differently as it doesn’t rely on adds or data collection to be sold to    advertisers. It allows new users to use, experience an application build on BitCoin SV and learn what BitCoin SV can do. The best way to introduce people is to let them use a tool they already need for business expenses and/or tax deductions such as keeping a mileage log. That why I created the Miles application concept. But the onboarding scheme could work on other similar useful applications as well.

   Important is that the application doesn’t focus on the “value” aspect of BitCoin SV other than it’s needed to obtain the “added     value” it has because it is built on BitCoin SV.  Another important aspect is that this “freemium” model incentivizes users to onboard and learn how to do this themselves up to a point they stop using the freemium model because it is more convenient to become a paying customer.  

   The different phases are explained in more detail in the follwing document:

WHAT IS MILES?
--------------
Miles is an simple mileage log application that leverages the unique properties of Bitcoin SV.

  -	Your data remains yours. The data you record is stored on BitCoin SV and is not sold to any third parties as with comparable “free” application. You are free to sell your data to any third parties you like for BSV by providing access to your data. 
  -	If the mileage is registered to be able to claim business expenses or tax refunds, you can provide access to your data so that you can be automatically compensated in BSV.
  -	Pay per use. Whenever you want to stop using it, you can without losing any money.
  -	You don’t lose data if you lose your phone or stop using the app. All you data is safely stored on BitCoin SV as long as needed so it is available in case you are audited years later. 




VISION ON ONBOARDING
-------------

Onboarding to BitCoin SV is a two-fold problem.
  - Distribution of BSV, and
  - Familiarize people with the technology and generate awareness about the benefits of BitCoin SV


DISTRIBUTION OF BSV

A much-discussed issue is how to enable people to obtain BitCoin SV. This is in my opinion a problem that can easily be solved and will resolve itself if there is sufficient demand for applications that utilize the unique characteristics that only Bitcoin SV can offer. In addition, this problem can also be easily solved by application suppliers if they work with a subscription fee where they accept Fiat money and implement a BitPipe (https://github.com/unwriter/bitpipe) solution to facilitate BitCoin transactions for end-users. This way the end-user does not even have to be aware that BitCoin SV is being used.

FAMILIARIZE PEOPLE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND BENIFITS OF BITCOIN SV

The real problem with onboarding as I view it is to get enough people familiarized with the technology and to make them aware of the added value that BitCoin SV has to offer. How to use a wallet as MoneyButton and how to buy BitCoin SV. If you succeed in this, demand will naturally arise and supply will follow. You can achieve this by offering applications that demonstrate the different facets of BitCoin SV.


THE ADDED VALUE OF ADMINISTRATION ON BITCOIN 
--------------------------------------------
BitCoin has a number of special qualities that are of particular interest for business administration and provides added value for many business administrative operations. In particular if the administration is intended as evidence for internal or external control. In evidence, important elements to record are: Who, What, Where, Why, When.

BitCoin has clear added value in particular in regard to Who and When:

  - Who is provable thanks to the use of a public and private key
  - When is provable thanks to a generated timestamp

The aspects What, Where and Why must be recorded by the user. BitCoin cannot prevent human errors in administrative actions, but it does make fraud considerably more difficult and much easier to trace.

The Write Once, Read Many (WORM) quality of BitCoin and the decentralized data storage ensure that once data has been recorded it cannot be changed by anyone afterwards or that all mutations are transparent.
