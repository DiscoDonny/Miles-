Bitcoin has a number of special qualities that are of particular interest for business use.


THE ADDED VALUE OF ADMINISTRATION ON BITCOIN
--------------------------------------------
BitCoin has great added value for many administrative operations. In particular if the administration is intended as evidence for internal or external control. In evidence, important elements to record are: Who, What, Where, Why, When.

BitCoin has clear added value in particular in regard to Who and When:

  - Who is provable thanks to the use of a public and private key
  
  - When is provable thanks to a generated timestamp

The aspects What, Where and Why must be recorded by the user. BitCoin cannot prevent human errors in administrative actions, but it does make fraud considerably more difficult and much easier to trace.

The Write Once, Read Many (WORM) quality of BitCoin and the decentralized data storage ensure that once data has been recorded it cannot be changed by anyone afterwards or that all mutations are transparent.
